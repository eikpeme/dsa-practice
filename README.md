## ðŸš€ **GitHub Workflows**
This repo includes automated workflows:
- **Linting:** Ensures code follows best practices using ESLint.
- **Testing:** Runs test cases to verify correctness.

### **Setting Up Workflows**
1. **Linting (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)**
```yaml
name: Lint Code
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
```

2. **Testing (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)**
```yaml
name: Run Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
